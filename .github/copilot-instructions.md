This project is a Python-based keyword extractor web app. It extracts keywords from either pasted text or the content of a provided URL, similar to https://wordcount.com/keyword-extractor. Use popular NLP libraries for keyword extraction (e.g., RAKE, YAKE, spaCy). The UI should be modern and user-friendly.
